In particular, it is robust against common aliasing issues found with other period-finding algorithms.}",

	abstract = {We present a new method of extending the single-band multiharmonic analysis of variance period estimation algorithm to multiple bands. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 RR Lyrae to show that in the case of a low number of observations per band and non-simultaneous observations, improvements in period recovery rates of up to ≈50% are observed. We also investigate the effect of inter-band observing cadence on period recovery rates. We find that using non-simultaneous observation times between bands is ideal for the multiband method, and using simultaneous multiband data is only marginally better than using single-band data. These results will be particularly useful in planning observing cadences for wide-field astronomical imaging surveys such as Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. They also have the potential to improve the extraction of transient data from surveys with few (≲30) observations per band across several bands, such as the Dark Energy Survey.}

	abstract = {The classical methods for searching for a periodicity in uneven sampled observations suffer from a poor match of the model and true signals and/or use of a statistic with poor properties. We present a new method employing periodic orthogonal polynomials to fit the observations and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistic to evaluate the quality of the fit. The orthogonal polynomials constitute a flexible and numerically efficient model of the observations. Among all popular statistics, ANOVA has optimum detection properties as the uniformly most powerful test. Our recurrence algorithm for expansion of the observations into the orthogonal polynomials is fast and numerically stable. The expansion is equivalent to an expansion into Fourier series. Aside from its use of an inefficient statistic, the Lomb-Scargle power spectrum can be considered a special case of our method. Tests of our new method on simulated and real light curves of nonsinusoidal pulsators demonstrate its excellent performance. In particular, dramatic improvements are gained in detection sensitivity and in the damping of alias periods.}
